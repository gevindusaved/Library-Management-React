          A banking system is a comprehensive digital platform designed to
          manage and streamline the financial operations and services provided
          by a bank or financial institution. It enables the secure handling of
          essential banking functions such as customer onboarding, account
          creation, deposit and withdrawal management, loan processing,
          transaction tracking, and interest calculations. Modern banking
          systems aim to enhance customer experience through automation,
          real-time data processing, and seamless access to services. With
          robust authentication mechanisms and data integrity checks, they
          ensure the security and privacy of sensitive financial information.
          Additionally, these systems often integrate with APIs, reporting
          tools, and regulatory frameworks to maintain compliance and
          transparency.
